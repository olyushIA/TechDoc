        <header>Bootstrap</header>
        <p>Developed by Jacob Thornton and Mark Otto at Twitter to promote consistency across internal tools, Bootstrap is an open-source framework containing CSS and JavaScript-based templates for interface components.</p>
        <p>Bootstrap is known for popularizing the focus on responsive design among web developers. It promoted the now-ubiquitous concept of mobile-first and provided the right tools for its easy implementation. It did so by introducing a grid – partitioning the screen into columns (invisible to the end user’s eye).</p>
        <p>With Bootstrap, developers don’t have to build separate projects around adjusting a site for smaller screen sizes. They must incorporate the necessary Bootstrap classes, and the design adjusts itself.</p>
        <p class="why">Why Choose Bootstrap?</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Massive Ecosystem:</b> Among front-end frameworks, Bootstrap’s ecosystem is unmatched. It offers a vast library of layouts, themes, UI elements, panels, modals, buttons, alerts, cards, etc., that devs and designers can choose from and implement. Additionally, Bootstrap is backed by best-in-industry community support.</li>
          <li><b>Accelerated prototyping:</b> Using Bootstrap, designers can write their HTML code, include the relevant CSS classes, and achieve website responsiveness. They don’t have to spend time adjusting for browser incompatibility, CSS positioning, and the like.</li>
          <li><b>Twitter Support:</b> Unsurprisingly, when a significant commercial player backs an open-source project, users can be assured that it is here to stay and carries high confidence among people who know the industry. The fact that Bootstrap grew out of, and is backed by Twitter, establishes its efficacy.</li>
          <li><b>Supports SASS and LESS:</b> Although most developers don’t use LESS, significant projects rely on it. SASS support is also highly desirable. Not too many CSS frameworks other than Bootstrap support both.</li>

      <section class="main-section" id="Tailwind_CSS">
        <header>Tailwind CSS</header>
        <p>Tailwind CSS’s official documentation describes it as a “utility-first CSS framework” with classes equipped to build custom UI designs directly in the users’ markup. It is handy to implement inline styling to rustle up a stunning UI without writing any CSS.</p>
        <p>One of the most popular utility CSS libraries, Tailwind CSS, offers significant benefits for web design. Interestingly, it took Adam Wathan (the creator of Tailwind) to convince the world why utility-based CSS trumps semantic CSS. But eventually, enough developers believed him enough to start using Tailwind, and now it is used frequently enough to be on lists like this.</p>
        <p class="why">Why Choose Tailwind CSS?</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Highly Customizable:</b> Tailwind CSS has a default configuration but can be overridden with a tailwind.config.js file. This enables easy customization of styling, themes, spacing, palettes, etc. Use Tailwind’s utilities to enable easy project management and develop a website that delights customers.</li>
          <li><b>Carries Commonly used Utility Pattern:</b> With Tailwind CSS, users can cut down on having to name too many classes. It comes with common utility patterns for standard requirements: specifying and organizing classes, cascading classes, etc. In simple terms, creating custom components become so much easier. Instead of hard coding, derive values from configuration files using the theme() function.</li>
          <li><b>PurgeCSS Optimization:</b> PurgeCSS reduces file size by scanning HTML code and eliminating unused classes. In combination with Tailwind CSS, this is particularly useful. As a project expands, so does the size of accompanying CSS files. Optimizing via PurgeCSS reduces and cleans up CSS file size, making it infinitely more manageable, especially before deployment.</li>
          <li><b>Responsiveness Made Easy:</b> By default, Tailwind CSS utilizes a mobile-first approach. To quote the website, “Every utility class in Tailwind can be applied conditionally at different breakpoints, which makes it a piece of cake to build complex responsive interfaces without ever leaving your HTML.”Utility classes simplify the creation of complex responsive layouts but allow them to be used across multiple breakpoints. The result? Hassle-free implementation of responsive design.</li>

          <li><b>Effortless Community Interaction:</b> Tailwind’s active community is an excellent place for users to get their questions answered, especially when dealing with stubborn issues. Get CSS-related queries solved and create excellent websites faster.</li>

      <section class="main-section" id="Foundation">
        <header>Foundation</header>
        <p>The foundation calls itself “The most advanced responsive front-end framework in the world.” This responsive front-end framework provides a grid, HTML, SASS, and CSS UI elements, templates, and code that covers navigation, buttons, typography, forms, etc. It also comprises optional functionalities offered by JavaScript extensions.</p>
        <p>Formerly managed by ZURB, Foundation is open-source project volunteers have run since 2019. It also operates with a mobile-first approach and is particularly useful for building large web apps requiring a design host.</p>
        <p class="why">Why Choose Foundation?</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Massive toolkit:</b> Foundation offers more than a CSS framework requires. Its extensive, modular collection of tools helps solve issues for most front-end developers. For example, it offers separate framework elements for websites and emails; each prepped for functioning in those domains. It also provides a command-line interface (CLI), handy for devs working with module bundlers like Webpack.</li>
          <li><b>Greater Flexibility:</b> Foundation is built to offer front-end devs complete control over their UIs. For example, it doesn’t force devs to use a particular style or language. This makes it a preferred tool for a much wider range of developers.</li>
          <li><b>UI components and beyond:</b> Along with offering the standard UI components, Foundation also has a responsive image system, a pricing table, responsive embeds, form validation, right-to-left support, and much more. This gives web developers a lot more to play with.</li>
          <li><b>Training Options:</b> ZURB offers multiple training courses and consulting options for Foundation, which is especially helpful for companies that want to work on big projects and pay for it.</li>

        <header>Skeleton</header>

It contains all standard components for responsive design and splits the page into multiple 12-column grids with a maximum width of 960px – something that fits small, medium, and large screens.

      <section class="main-section" id="Criteria_for_Evaluating_CSS_Frameworks">
        <header>Criteria for Evaluating CSS Frameworks</header>
        <p>Evaluating and comparing multiple frameworks based on your specific requirements is essential before deciding. In 2023, when evaluating and choosing the best CSS framework, you can consider the following criteria:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Features and Components: Assess the framework’s offerings in pre-designed components, responsive grid systems, typography, icons, form elements, and other UI elements. Look for a comprehensive range of features that align with your project requirements.</li>
          <li>Customizability: Evaluate the framework’s flexibility and ease of customization. Consider whether it allows you to easily modify styles, colors, and layouts without compromising maintainability.</li>
          <li>Responsiveness: Verify the framework’s robust support for creating responsive web designs. Look for features like responsive grids, breakpoints, and utility classes that simplify building responsive layouts.</li>
          <li>Performance: Consider the impact of the framework on website performance. Look for frameworks prioritizing optimized CSS and minimizing file size, reducing page load times for improved user experience.</li>
          <li>Browser Compatibility: Ensure the framework supports major web browsers and their versions. Compatibility with older browsers may be necessary, depending on your target audience.</li>
